Debugging situation where scoop fails to import a file : 

Step 1: Check the error log 

1. If connection to SQL server fails (Eg: MYSQL) then restart it

command : sudo restart mysql

2. If it states that one of the Hadoop services is not working - check for the the services up and running

command : jps

If something is missing out of these :

JobTracker
SecondaryNameNode
NameNode
Jps
TaskTracker
DataNode

Then , stop all the services and start them again 

command 1: stop-all.sh
command 2: start-all.sh
command 3: jps

All services should be up and running now

3. If the error says that one of the service is running in SAFE MODE (This indicates that you have to free some memory)

command : free -m

Step 2: Execute the Scoop Import command now
